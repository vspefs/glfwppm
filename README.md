# GLFW C++ wrapper - glfwpp ![logo](logo.png)

There's no README for glfwppm yet. Please check back later. However, you can check [the original glfwpp](https://github.com/vspefs/glfwppm) README below. (Also the logo isn't updated yet.)

> GLFWPP or (GLFW C++ Wrapper) is a thin, modern C++17 layer on top of [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/). It supports GLFW versions from 3.2 up to the current 3.3.6. From [the official GLFW website](https://www.glfw.org/):
>
> > GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop. It provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events.
> > GLFW is written in C and supports Windows, macOS, X11 and Wayland.
> > GLFW is licensed under the zlib/libpng license.

> I like C++ and OOP, so when I find a C library, I immediately look for a wrapper which offers RAII objects instead of free `create` and `destroy` functions, identifiers wrapped in `namespace`s, methods instead of free functions, scoped `enum`s instead of macros and exceptions instead of error codes. In case of GLFW I didn't really find such a library, so I made one myself.
